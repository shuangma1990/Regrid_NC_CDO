Can use command line and CDO to aggregate entire NC files. CDO homepage: https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo
This page is helpful for describing regridding: https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Tutorial#Interpolation
Basic CDO and nc commands for taking a look at your data, and some basic usage: https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Tutorial

Horizontal interpolation can be done with the CDO operators:
remapbil - Bilinear interpolation
remapbic - Bicubic interpolation
remapdis - Distance-weighted average remapping
remapnn - Nearest neighbor remapping
remapcon - First order conservative remapping
remapcon2- Second order conservative remapping 
see this paper for the differences of con and con2: https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/127/9/1520-0493_1999_127_2204_fasocr_2.0.co_2.xml

install cdo to your linux using:

sudo apt-get install cdo

If you get a package not found error, run:

sudo apt-get update

cdo remapcon,r360x180 CMS-Flux.monthly.only.GCP.grid.2010-2020.nc CMS-Flux.monthly.only.GCP.grid.2010-2020.1deg.nc

On mac-os, to install cdo, ran:

brew install cdo

by default, can ran:

cdo remapcon,r360x180 infile outfile
% this function makes 360 columns and 180 rows based on the lon and lat of your input file
% eg. if resample 1deg map from 4by5 map, by default the center is -89.75 and edge is -89.5;
% if you desire to define the edges exactly as you need (eg. -90 on left edge, center point be -89.5)
% then you need to write a txt file to define your own values, name the file gridfile.txt and run:

cdo -remapcon,gridfile.txt infile outfile

in your gridfile.txt:

gridtype  = lonlat
gridsize  = 64800
datatype  = float
xsize     = 360
ysize     = 180
xname     = longitude
xlongname = "Longitude"
xunits    = "degrees_east"
yname     = latitude
ylongname = "Latitude"
yunits    = "degrees_north"
xfirst    = -180
xinc      = 1
yfirst    = -90
yinc      = 1
